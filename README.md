## Dependancies
Install


## Dataset

## CF Method and Evaluation
User-based Collaborative Filtering, as a unsupervised method, does not learning any parameter using gradient descent (or any other optimization algorithm). Instead, it uses cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficients, which are only based on arithmetic operations.

## Testing on system

## Run Locally
The demo of system output is returned JSON values from FastAPI.
